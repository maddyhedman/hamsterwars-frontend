I created a fullstack app called Hamsterwars. In here you can vote for the cutest hamster, see which hamsters are available but also add own hamsters so you can customize the battle of the cutets!

I used react for the first time in my projects and completed the requirement for G-level. I did unfortunately not have enough time to complete next level but im proud of my efforts for what i actuall achived. After his project i am looking forward to working even more with react. 


Tools i used for this project: 

- VS Code
- React
- TypeScript
- Figma
- Insomnia
- Heroku
- Firestore
- Express
